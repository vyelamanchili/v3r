About this module ("MBDA Zoom Map")
----------------------------------------

Use this module to upload a set of maps and regional office information to generate and display an interactive AJAX map. This map will zoom or display regional office info based on the coordinates of the map you click on. 

Configuration:

Use the "admin/settings/mbdazoommap" configuration page to add images of the maps and the zoomed part of the maps to the database and add regional office information along with the (x,y) coordinates of the office in the map.
Example: integrating the MBDA style sheet, adding global functions used by all pages.
