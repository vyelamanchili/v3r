Theme Name: WP-Forge
File Name: Changelog
Tested up to: 4.3.1
Stable tag: 5.5.3.1

== Changelog ==

= 5.5.3.1 =
* Added WooCommerce support back into theme.
* Changed the style for pre code.
* Removed the Google Analytics code from the header which was accidentally left there when I was updating the child theme I use on the site.

= 5.5.3 =
* Updated to the latest version of Foundation
* Added <?php get_template_part( 'content', get_post_format() ); ?> to search.php. originally it was <?php get_template_part( 'content', 'loop' ); ?>. There is no content-loop.php so this needed to be changed accordingly.

= 5.5.2.7 =
* Corrected an issue with the top-bar displaying alongside the off-canvas menu.
* Updated Genericons to 3.4.1
* Removed extra copy of .po file

= 5.5.2.6 =
* Set the default display of post thumbnails to yes for the customizer view.
* Corrected the issue with the footer text area. Now users can insert html.
* Corrected issue with archive, tag and search pages not showing excerpts if Show full post or excerpt? is set to excerpt. Also added post thumbal display to archive, tag and search pages.
* Corrected an issue with off-canvas for mobile where the hamburger icon text was not showing.
* Moved all Off-Canvas settings to Mobile Menu View. This makes it easier to access the off-canvas settings instead of the user having to go back and forth to different sections.
* Added Font-Awesome back into the mix. I have been receiving a lot of emails asking for this to be brought back, so I decided why not.
* Moved the Show home page title section into the Static Front Page Section.
* Renamed the panels in customizer. Instead of sections they are now called options. Also modified some of the descriptions of the panels and secions.
* Updated README.txt
* Updated verbiage of style.css

= 5.5.2.5 =
* Corrected an issue that was caused with the release of WordPress 4.3 - The changes that were made to the customizer in core removed or renamed an area. This change caused an error message to be displayed when viewing the customizer.
* Removed Site Favicon from the customizer. This is being handled now by Site Identity (a new section of the customizer added in core.)
* Renamed Navigation Section to Menu Options.

= 5.5.2.4 =
* Corrected an issue with the top-bar menu in header.php - the default normal position was not displaying once the theme was activated or updated. Adding the default value into header.php seems to have corrected the issue. This is why menus were disappearing after activation and update.
* Corrected an issue with the title text not showing in the off-canvas menu when set to Off-Canvas in the Menu Selection setting.
* Reconfigured the Top-Bar Settings and Off-Canvas Settings areas. Thanks to user Geertje KÃ¶nig who emailed me suggesting the change. This change not only makes perfect sense, it also makes this area easier to use. Basically I moved a few things around.
* Added an admin notice that will appear when the theme is first activated. This was initially supposed to be added to 5.5.2.2 but was left out by mistake.

= 5.5.2.3 =
*cancelled update

= 5.5.2.2 =
* Fixed the search button issue. This was caused by the Foundation update. Seems they changed something and it was causing the text on the search button to display towards the bottom of the button.
* Wrapped all functions in customizer.php in "if function_exists" statements. Now the customizer can be overwritten easily with "remove_action".
* Adjusted the line height of the h1.entry-title element. I felt there was too much space when the line wrapped.
* Increased the font size for buttons, to me it looks better and is easier to see.
* Switched where the post thumbnail was being displayed in single post view. I never noticed before but the entry-meta was showing below the post thumbnail. Single post view is supposed to display the same as home (blog) view. Now it does.
* Added featured images to pages. Seems to make sense to me that if featured images are available in posts they should also be available for pages as well. Thanks to user geotn for pointing it out https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-featured-image-work-for-this-theme-featured-image-not-working
* Removed the jQuery function that added "th" to featured images. Adding "th" to featured images added the white border. I received a lot of emails asking how this can be removed.
* Updated Genericons to 3.3.1
* Increased the size of the Customizer area. I was seeing the top of the left panels being blocked a little, where some of the information in the panel or section was being blocked. Increasing the size has corrected the issue so far. It has reduced real estate in the customizer preview panel just a little.
* Added favicon to admin area and login page. This makes the favicon consistent throughout the entire site if a user uploads a custom favicon.
* Added the top-bar color to the ul when the top-bar is set to the scroll or fixed position. If there is more than one line of links and the links wrapped to  second line, the background was transparent. This looked awkward. This corrects the issue.
* Fixed an issue with the top-bar displaying along with the off-canvas menu in mobile view.
* Added the abilty to show or hide catgories, post meta and post tags in posts. You also have the ability to choose whether or not to show the categories above the post title or above the post tags.
* Adjusted the font size of the code block displayed at the end of the comments form. It was kind of big and blocky and didn't look right to me.
* Added a About WP-Forge admin page. This gives users a brief overview of WP-Forge as well as links to the WP-Forge Quick Start Guide, a link to the WP-Forge support forums and a link to download WP-Starter.
* Added the option to hide the title area of the top-bar. This only affects the top-bar in the normal and contain-to-grid-sticky positions.
* Added the option to float links in the top-bar to the right (default) or left positions when the top-bar is in the top of browser - scroll and top of browser - fixed positions.
* Added a hr to the content area. This will only display when off-canvas is used in mobile. I added this because there was no separation of header or main content area in mobile view.
* Added "hide-for-small hide-for-medium" to the top-bar in content-nav.php. This prevents the top-bar from showing along with the off-canvas menu when "Use Off-Canvas for Mobile?" is set to yes.
* Added Off-Canvas as a menu option. This means you can use the Off-Canvas menu as your sites menu.
* Added Off-Canvas color options to the customizer. Now users can change the colors associated with the Off-Canvas menu.
* Added the ability for users to hide the title of any page set as the Home page. Users must have the front-page template assigned to the page in order for it to work.
* Corrected issue with the bakground color of the Nav-Wrapper showing through when Contain-To-Grid-Sticky was selected.
* Added the ability to change the color and hover color of links in the Social Menu.
* Removed the different colors from the Social Menu links. All links are one color now.
* Updated screenshot.png

= 5.5.2 =
* Updated to the latest version of Foundation 5.5.2
* Renamed the setting and control for sidebar colors. With the new WP 4.2 update this caused an issue with the way those mods were named. Mods renamed and issue is corrected.
* Corrected issue with the site title and site description. Any colors assigned being handled by both the customizer as well as the style sheet. Moved all control of these to the customizer.
* Removed the container colors from the cutomizer and to the style sheet. No need for these to be in the customizer when all can be controlled in one area. The background color of these containers were preventing any background image to show through. Now these background colors can be set individually in the style sheet.
* Corrected an issue with the top-bar when placed in Contain-To-Grid-Sticky. This was causing the main Home link to move to the right.
* Removed html5 support for gallery and caption. See the following as to why this was removed: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/html5-wp-gallery-5518
* Added the ability to upload a favicon.
* Adjusted the body class function in functions.php, line 703
* Updated .po file
* Corrected an issue with the the footer sidebar class being mislabeled in style.css. https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/44

= 5.5.1.8 =
* Modified the description of WP-Forge in style.css.
* Removed Font-Awesome icon set. Using nothing but Genericons.
* Adjusted post thumbnail size from 653 to 685. This coincides with the content width set on line 28 of functions.php
* Added html 5 support for gallery and caption.
* Added fix for TinyMCE editor jumping all over the place. Thanks to Matt Van Andel for the fix: https://github.com/zurb/foundation/issues/6380
* Added editor-style.css - took TinyMCE Editor styles out of style css and put them here. Post and Page editor display exactly like the front end.
* Added css to hide the smiley face for stats if using Jetpack plugin on line 1299. If using Jetpack and you select the option to hide the smiley face, additional style tags are added to the header. In my opinion this doesn't look very good and adds more bloat.
* Added the .contain-to-grid element to the top-bar color css in customizer.php. Now when you select a color for the top-bar, the contain-to-grid element will take on the new color. Thanks to BadCat for pointing this out: http://www.badcat.com/
* Added version to enqueued style sheets for security. I did this to reflect the version of the theme instead of the WordPress version
* Adjusted an issue with the theme displaying horizontal scrolling when using a header image and hiding the site title and site description. https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/issues/40 - Thanks again to BadCat for pointing it out http://www.badcat.com/
* Added styling for Gravity Forms plugin. In IE submit buttons look squished. Removing the padding makes the submit buttons look normal (line 1306 of style.css)
* Added back the ability to change the active hover state in top-bar. I had intended to remove it as I thought it redundent, however after user atelier_tsukee brought it to my attention (https://wordpress.org/support/topic/customiser-top_bar_active_hover_color), I decided to add it back.
* Removed customizer.css from the css folder. This was accidentally left over when I was attempting something with the customizer.
* Added the .content_container background color to the customizer. Somehow this got taken out at some point.
* Added the ability to change the font color and hover font color in the top-bar via the customizer.
