== Description ==

A simple, responsive theme, WP-Forge is a combination of two powerful platforms. The first, of course, being WordPress, the leading open source blogging tool and content management system. The second being ZURB Foundation, the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. Foundation comes packed with all kinds of goodies. You get cool things like tooltips, modal popups, a slider, pricing tables and a whole bunch more. Combine that with WordPress and you get a responsive WordPress theme that makes creating websites fun and exciting again! You can use WP-Forge right out of the box, or use it with WP-Starter (WP-Forges' WordPress child theme) to build the site you've always wanted.

== Using rem values ==
When you look at the style.css file you will notice that a majority of the values use rem (root em). I used the following tool to help with determining what rem value I needed to add:

*When inputting a value for these divs, you can use px if that is what you are comfortable with. I do however recommend you use rem values to set the width of these divs.
