// Description
///////////////////////////////////

WP-Forge is A WordPress Foundation theme that combinds two powerful platforms: WordPress, the leading open source blogging tool and content management system and ZURB's Foundation, the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. Foundation comes packed with all kinds of goodies. You get cool things like tooltips, modal popups, a slider, pricing tables and a whole lot more. By combining WordPress and Foundation you get a theme that makes creating websites fun and exciting again!

Using rem values 
=================
When you look at the style.css file you will notice that a majority of the values use rem (root em). I used the following tool to help with determining what rem value I needed to add:

*When inputting a value for these divs, you can use px if that is what you are comfortable with. I do however recommend you use rem values to set the width of these divs.
